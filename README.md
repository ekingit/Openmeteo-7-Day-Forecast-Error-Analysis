This is a simple practice project for me to learn how to utilize web-APIs and become familiar with Python syntax, Python conventions and GitHub.

I created a function which takes a city name or an address as an input and gives coordinates of the city and produces weather forecasts for the next 7 days.


One can use the following command to call the function from the command line:
python -c "import weather; print(weather.city_name('Vienna'))"
